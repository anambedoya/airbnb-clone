# Airbnb Clone

Final project made for the RoR GAP bootcamp. It consists on a minimal vacation rental service app where the users with no need of login can see properties uploaded by a host and they can make a reservation.

Some considerations:

* To run the project you just need to clone it and type in a terminal: bundle install (to install all the dependencies) and then: rails s (to start the server)

* To run the tests with rspec, type: rspec

* If you prefer to see the live version, go to: http://gapairbnbclone.herokuapp.com/
